# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

- Fixing bugs in the `parse_rst_multiple` function within `src/parser.rs`.

## Recent Changes

- Refactored the `parse_rst_multiple` function in `src/parser.rs` to address two specific parsing bugs:
    - Ensured directive names are validated for allowed characters and do not span newlines.
    - Improved logic for advancing the parsing position (`current_pos`) to correctly handle `..` sequences that are not part of target directives, preventing premature skipping.
- Introduced a helper function `is_valid_directive_name_char` in `src/parser.rs` to validate characters in directive names.
- Previous work involved a full review and update of the memory bank based on project files.

## Next Steps

- Update `.clinerules/memory-bank/progress.md` to reflect the attempted bug fixes.
- Run `cargo test` to verify that the changes in `src/parser.rs` have fixed the identified bugs and that all tests pass.
- Based on test results, confirm task completion or address any new issues.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Ensuring all memory bank files are consistent with the information available from the project structure and source code.
- Adhering to the structure and purpose of each memory bank file as defined in `.clinerules/cline-memory-bank.md`.
- Avoiding speculation for sections where reviewed files do not provide explicit information (e.g., "What's Left to Build" in `progress.md`).

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- The memory bank is crucial for maintaining context between sessions.
- Updates should be thorough and reflect the current state accurately based on available information.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The project is a reStructuredText (RST) parser implemented in Rust.
- Key aspects include performance (benchmarks exist) and extensibility (custom directives in Python/C++).
- The project includes a library and a CLI tool.
- `main.rs` confirms the CLI argument structure (`clap`) and the orchestration of `FileWalker`, `Extractor`, `Parser`, `Processor`, and `Aggregator` modules.
- `lib.rs` confirms the public API and re-exported modules.
- The core functionality described in `progress.md` ("What Works") is validated by the structure observed in `main.rs`.
