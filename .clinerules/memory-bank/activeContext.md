# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

- Finalizing the update of the memory bank based on project file review.

## Recent Changes

- Reviewed `Cargo.toml`, `src/main.rs`, and `src/lib.rs`.
- Updated `.clinerules/memory-bank/techContext.md` with Rust edition, dependency versions, and benchmark details.
- Updated `.clinerules/memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` to ensure accuracy based on reviewed source files; the existing content was largely correct and confirmed.
- Reviewed `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md`; confirmed they are consistent with the information from `Cargo.toml`, `src/main.rs`, and `src/lib.rs`, requiring no changes.
- Reviewed `progress.md`; confirmed its "What Works" section is consistent with `src/main.rs`. Other sections remain "(To be filled)" as the reviewed files do not provide further details for them.

## Next Steps

- Confirm completion of the memory bank update task.
- Await further instructions or tasks from the user.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Ensuring all memory bank files are consistent with the information available from the project structure and source code.
- Adhering to the structure and purpose of each memory bank file as defined in `.clinerules/cline-memory-bank.md`.
- Avoiding speculation for sections where reviewed files do not provide explicit information (e.g., "What's Left to Build" in `progress.md`).

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- The memory bank is crucial for maintaining context between sessions.
- Updates should be thorough and reflect the current state accurately based on available information.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The project is a reStructuredText (RST) parser implemented in Rust.
- Key aspects include performance (benchmarks exist) and extensibility (custom directives in Python/C++).
- The project includes a library and a CLI tool.
- `main.rs` confirms the CLI argument structure (`clap`) and the orchestration of `FileWalker`, `Extractor`, `Parser`, `Processor`, and `Aggregator` modules.
- `lib.rs` confirms the public API and re-exported modules.
- The core functionality described in `progress.md` ("What Works") is validated by the structure observed in `main.rs`.
