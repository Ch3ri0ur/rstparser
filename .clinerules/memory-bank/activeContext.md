# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

- Initializing and populating the memory bank.

## Recent Changes

- Created all core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).
- Populated `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, and `techContext.md` with initial information based on the project structure and file names.

## Next Steps

- Review and update all memory bank files as per the user's request ("update memorybank").
- Await further instructions or tasks from the user.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Ensuring all memory bank files are consistent with the information available from the project structure.
- Adhering to the structure and purpose of each memory bank file as defined in `.clinerules/cline-memory-bank.md`.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- The memory bank is crucial for maintaining context between sessions.
- Updates should be thorough and reflect the current state accurately.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The project is a reStructuredText (RST) parser implemented in Rust.
- Key aspects include performance (benchmarks exist) and extensibility (custom directives in Python/C++).
- The project includes a library and potentially a CLI tool.
